## Executive Verdict

Readiness score is 70/100 because Qoder workflow assets are visible and bounded
session evidence shows repeated validation habits.

## Evidence Boundary

- AI Agent practice scope: inspected project Rules, Skills, MCP, Plugins, and Session Insights; hook execution remains unverified.
- Session source probe: node scripts/session-analysis.mjs sources --platform qoder --workspace /Users/example/workspace/better-harness --format markdown showed enabled workspace roots.

## Signals And Diagnosis

Observed project-capability spread across current evidence.

## Action Pathways

| Pathway | Trigger evidence | Next action | Pass check | Owner | Timing | Evidence artifact | Impact |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Explain model | scorecard labels | add notes | notes visible at the end | owner | Now | report.md | Medium |

## Unverified Items

- Runtime.

## Diagnostic Model Notes

| Dimension | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Context Map | Can an agent understand project boundaries and task routes quickly? |
| Environment Readiness | Can an agent set up, run, reset, and operate the workspace? |
| Fast Feedback | Can an agent get fast, actionable feedback after a change? |
| Quality Gates | Are important rules mechanically enforced? |
| Change Safety | Can agent-produced changes be constrained at runtime, checked before acceptance, and prevented from unsafe side effects or uncontrolled delivery? |

Adaptive Engineering Loop synthesizes evidence across the five project capabilities as an improvement loop.
